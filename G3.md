The questions that we are most interested in exploring with our low-fidelity prototype is how receptive people would be to making plans with their friends based on our suggestions (both of times and activities). Will having our app start the planning process increase the likelihood of people following through? 


In order to test this, we asked our friends to submit their availability through when2meet. We created three separate forms, one for each friend group, so that people would only be matched with their friends. This mimics the “friending” feature of our future application. 
Then, we manually went through the when2meets and found times where people in the same group were available. 
We will find activities to do in Seattle and text the groups of people a suggestion of what to do during the time that they are all available. Each member of the group will text someone else’s friend group so that the text will come from an anonymous number and not their friend. 
The parts that are “wizardry” is that we are manually going through people’s availability and texting them instead of automating this process. We also are manually finding events when our actual application would have a database of events. Additionally, instead of having users “friend” other users we are assuming that everyone in the same friend group would be open to meeting up with each other. 












We asked people to fill out their availability like this: 

This was the form people filled out: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewZSWh3TrDqbB1cPTpx3mcoqt8CMRYVBNWSm2y-te_MRVI8w/viewform?usp=sf_link


For privacy’s sake, each person could only see their own availability. We can see everyone’s availability in order to match people, so we aggregated everyone in the group’s availability into a whentomeet so that we can decide what activities to suggest and when. This is what one of the final whentomeets looked like for one of the groups:
